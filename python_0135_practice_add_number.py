find the value of s
s = a + aa + aaa + aaaa + aa...aï¼Œ
a can be any number from 1 to 9
term count comes from user input in console.
For example:
Enter the base number: 2
Enter the term count: 5
The answer is 24690
Explanation:
2 + 22 + 222 + 2222 + 22222 is 24690

# Observation
# term 0 - 5
# term 1 - 55 = 5 * 10 + 5

# term 3 - 5555 = 5 * (5 * (5 * 10 + 5) + 5) + 5

# Summary
# term 0 = Loop 0 times [* 10 + 5]
# term 1 = Loop 1 times [* 10 + 5]
# term 2 = Loop 2 times [* 10 + 5]
# term 3 = Loop 3 times [* 10 + 5]

Question:
How many times the calculate (line 35) will be executed?
Let's say, in total we have n terms.
Answer: 1 + 2 + 3 ... + n
      = (1 + n) * n / 2
      = 1/2 * n^2 + 1/2 * n

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time Complexity means: how code slows as data grows
Time Complexity answer this question: how much slower the code will go if you give it ten times more data.
We use Big-O to express this.
When n = 10;  it calculate = 1/2 * 10 * 10     + 1/2 * 10   = 50    + 5  = 55   times      
When n = 100; it calculate = 1/2 * 100 * 100   + 1/2 * 100  = 5000  + 50 = 5050 times - when data grows 10 times, roughly, code slows 100 times.      
The driven factor is n^2, (1/2 * n) can be ignored.
So we say: Big-O(n^2)
O(1)
O(n)
O(n^2)

question:
how many times the calculate will be executed
let's say ,intotal we have n terms
answer:n-1
time complexity :O(n)
when n=10,it calculates10-1=9times
when n=100,it calculates100-1=99times
so,when data grows 10 times,roughly,code slows 10 times.
the driving factor is n,-1 can be ignore
so we say big-O(n)
