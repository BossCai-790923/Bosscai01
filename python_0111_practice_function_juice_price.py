-------------------------------------
step 2) CLogic:
-------------------------------------
conclusion 1) 
Total situation = 2 juice * 2 container * material * 2 supermarket
                = 16 situations

I use nested loop to cover all 16 situations
for container in containers: 
    for current_juice in juice:
        for current_material in material:
            for supermarket in supermarkets:
                # here, we have 4 variables: container / current_juice / current_material / supermarket
                # my core logic is here

conclusion 2)                                 
Inside the loop body, what shall we do? 
Step 1) calculate the container's surface and volume.
        So we define a function:
        def surface_and_volume(container):
            pass
Step 2) use container's surface and volume / juice / material to calculate the cost of the juice to the factory
       so we define a function:
       def calculate_cost(container_data, juice, material):
           pass            

Step 3) because the factory needs to make 30% profit, so based on the cost to the factory, we can calculate the price so the supermarket.
      so we define a function:
      def sold_price_to_supermarket(cost):
         pass

Step 4) because ntuc and coldstorage need to make profit, so same import price from factory has a different selling price to customerã€‚
     So we define a function:
     def sold_price_to_customer(cost, supermarket):
        pass
